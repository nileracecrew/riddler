First, suppose there is only 1 coin on the board at space n. We can compute the probability that we miss it recursively. For  1 <= n <= 6, it's possible that hit or missing n is determined on the first roll:

P(miss 1) = 5/6 [roll > 1]
P(miss 2) = 4/6 + 1/6 * P(miss 1) [roll > 2 or roll 1 and then miss the next space]
P(miss 3) = 3/6 + 1/6 * P(miss 1) + 1/6 * P(miss 2) [roll > 3 or roll 2 and then miss the next space or roll 1 and then miss the second next space]
...
P(miss 6) = 0/6 + 1/6 * P(miss 1) + ... 1/6 * P(miss 5) [roll > 6 (impossible) or roll k < 6 and then miss the space 6-k away]

For n > 6, the first roll does not immediately decide whether we hit or miss space n. So, the possible ways of missing space n are first roll is a 1 and we miss space n-1, or first roll is a 2 and we miss space n-2, and so on.  In other words:

P(miss n) = 1/6 * sum(k = n-6 to n-1, P(miss k)) 

To compute the joint probability that we miss two spaces n1 and n2, we can use the law of total probability:

P(miss n1 and miss n2) = P(miss n2) - P(miss n2 and hit n1)
                       = P(miss n2) - P(miss n2|hit n1) * P(hit n1)
                       = P(miss n2) - P(miss [n2-n1]) * (1 - P(miss n1))

Note that P(miss n2|hit n1) = P(miss [n2-n1]) since if we are at space n1, then the probability that we miss n2 is just the same as the probability of missing space [n2-n1] when we start from the beginning.

We can build on this to calculate the probability of missing three spaces:

P(miss n1 and miss n2 and miss n3) = P(miss n2 and n3) - P(miss n2 and miss n3 and hit n1)
                                   = P(miss n2 and n3) - P(miss [n2-n1] and miss [n3-n1]) * P(hit n1)
                                   = P(miss n2 and n3) - P(miss [n2-n1] and miss [n3-n1]) * (1 - P(miss n1))

To find the best play for survival, we need to search over n1,n2,n3 to minimize this probability.  P(miss n) converges quickly, so it's more than sufficient to search up to n=100. Using a python script, we find that the optimal spaces are 4, 5, and 6. Probability of survival is ~0.794.

For martyrdom, we maximize this probability. This happens at spaces 1, 2, and 7. Probability of death is ~0.525.

For non-adjacent coins, we just limit the search space and find that the optimal spaces are 6, 8, and 10 with p(live) ~ 0.286; and 1, 3, and 7 with p(death) ~ 0.497.
